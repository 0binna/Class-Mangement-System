# Class Management System (CMS) API

The Class Management System models a school portal that comprises data management and database storage for effectively managing a class. 

## Motivation for the Project

This is the Capstone project for the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program by Udacity. It provides an opportunity to combine the skills Iâ€™ve learned and developed in this course to construct a database-backed web API with user access control. Concepts from the following technical topics where applied to develope this API:

1. Database modeling with `postgres` & `sqlalchemy` (see `models.py`)
2. API to perform CRUD Operations on database with `Flask` (see `app.py`)
3. Automated testing with `Unittest` (see `test_app`)
4. Authorization & Role based Authentication with `Auth0` (see `auth.py`)
5. Deployment on `Heroku`

## Database Classes

The database comprises the Student, Instructor, Course and Grade classes which all extends the base SQLALchemy Model. The Grade class is a an association object; it establishes a many to many relationship between Course and Student class.

## User Roles

There are 3 Roles with distinct permission sets:

1. Student:
   - Can see a list of the names of all instructors and email.
   - Can see any instructor profile.
   - Can search for any instructor; the search allows partial string matching and is case-insensitive.
   - Can add or remove course.
   - Can only see their profile.
2. Instructor:
   - Can perform the first three student roles.
   - Can see a list of the names and emails of all students.
   - Can search for any student; the search allows partial string matching and is case-insensitive.
   - Can see any student profile.
   - can edit their student's scores.
3. Admin:
   - Can perform all Instructor and Student roles.
   - Can delete student records. 

## Start Project locally

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.8** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Virtual Environment** - Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PostgreSQL** - Make sure to have PostgreSQL installed, if it is not installed, follow instructions to download PostgreSQL in [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

4. **PIP Dependencies** - Install the required dependencies by navigating to the project root directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `cms_db` database:

```bash
createdb cms_db
```
Apply Database Schema using Flask-Migrate. Apply the database schema and relationships by executing:

```bash
python manage.py db init  # creates a migration repository
python manage.py db migrate -m "Initial migration."  # generate an initial migration
python manage.py db upgrade # apply the migration to the database
```

Populate the database using the `cms.psql` file. From the root folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql cms_db < cms.psql
```
To run the server, execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

## API Documentation

### Base URL

https://cms-project-obi.herokuapp.com

### Error Handling

HTTP errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```bash
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 404,
    "message": "resource not found"
}
```
Authentication errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```bash
{
    'error': 401,
    'code': 'invalid_header',
    'description': 'Token not found.'
}
```

The API will return these error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable

## Authentication

### Setup Auth0

1. Create a new Auth0 Account
2. Select a unique tenant domain
3. Create a new, single page web application
4. Create a new API
   - in API Settings:
     - Enable RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
     - Enable Add Permissions in the Access Token
5. Create new API permissions:
   - `get:students`
   - `get:instructors`
   - `get:student_profile`
   - `get:instructor_profile`
   - `post:student_search`
   - `post:instructor_search`
   - `post:student_create`
   - `patch:student_edit`
   - `delete:student_course`
   - `delete:student_id`
6. Create new roles for:
   - Student
     - can `get:instructors`
     - can `get:instructor_profile`
     - can `post:instructor_search`
     - can `post:student_create`
     - can `get:student_profile`
   - Instructor
     - can perform the first three student roles.
     - can `get:students`
     - can `post:student_search`
     - can `patch:student_edit`
   - Admin
     - can perform all Instructor and Student roles.
     - can `delete:student_id`

In your API Calls, add them as Header, with Authorization as key and the Bearer token as value. Prepend Bearer to the token (see `.env` for header sample).

## Test App Locally (CRUD & RBAC)

Project includes tests to ensure RBAC permissions for CRUD operations are successful and persist accurately in the database for GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE HTTP requests.

Ensure `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` is set to local database path.

To deploy the tests, run
```bash
dropdb cms_db && createdb cms_db # Reset database
python manage.py db migrate 
python manage.py db upgrade
psql cms_db < cms.psql
python test_app.py
```

## Deploy to Heroku

This documentation assumes that the user already:
- Has a heroku account. The free account option would suffice for this project
- Has downloaded and installed the heroku command line interface locally, and
- Is able to login to heroku from the command line

### Login to Heroku

Use the heroku login command to login to heroku via the command line:
```bash
heroku login -i
```
### Procfile and runtime.txt files
Before pushing the project to heroku, ensure that a `runtime.txt` file and a `Procfile` are present in the project's root directory.

The procfile mention using gunicorn (production-ready WSGI server) to run the application:
```bash
web: gunicorn app:app
```

The runtime.txt file specifies the exact runtime environment:
```bash
python-3.8.13
```
### Create the project in Heroku cloud
While still logged in to heroku, create an app in heroku cloud. Ensure that your app has a unique name.
```bash
heroku create cms-project-obi --buildpack heroku/python
```
### Git repository on Heroku
Ensure that a Git remote repository was created on Heroku by the `heroku create` command.
```bash
git remote -v
```
If you cannot see the Heroku `remote` repository URL in the output, you can use the command:
```bash
git remote add heroku [heroku_remote_git_url]
```
### Add a postgreSQL addon for the database
Heroku has an addon for apps for a postgresql database instance. Run the following line of code in order to create the database and connect it to the application:
```bash
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app cms-project-obi
```
### Configure the application
In order to set up the environment variables in the Heroku cloud specific to the application, run the following command to fix the DATABASE_URL configuration variable:
```bash
heroku config --app cms-project-obi
```
### Update .env file
Copy the DATABASE_URL generated from the step above, and update your local `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in `.env` file.

### Push to Heroku
Commit the changes made to the above files, and then push the project to Heroku.
```bash
git push heroku master
```
### Migrate the database
To migrate your local database to heroku, run:
```bash
heroku run python manage.py db upgrade --app cms-project-obi
```
### Populate postgres database heroku 
Establish a psql session with the remote database:
```bash
heroku pg:psql
```
Populate the database using the `cms.psql` file:
```bash
\i cms.psql
```
### Confirm a successful build
If there were no errors from the above steps, Open the application from your Heroku Dashboard and see it work live!
